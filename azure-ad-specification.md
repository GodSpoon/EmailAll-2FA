# OATH Implementation for EmailAll-2FA in Azure Active Directory

## Introduction

This document provides guidance on implementing the EmailAll-2FA authentication method within Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) using Open Authentication (OATH) standards.

## Prerequisites

- Azure Active Directory Tenant
- Access to Azure Portal with administrative privileges
- Familiarity with Azure AD Conditional Access policies

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Azure AD for OATH Tokens

1. **Access Azure Portal**: Log in to the Azure Portal.
2. **Navigate to Azure AD**: Go to Azure Active Directory > Security > MFA.
3. **OATH Tokens Setup**: Select "OATH tokens" and prepare to register tokens that will represent each user's EmailAll-2FA credentials.

### Step 2: Define EmailAll-2FA Token

1. **Create a New Token**: For each user, create a new token with a unique identifier that corresponds to their email address.
2. **Token Type**: Choose the token type as "Hardware Token" (represents the email-based 2FA mechanism).
3. **Key**: Enter a secret key, which will be used in the email reply-all verification process.

### Step 3: Integrate with Azure AD Conditional Access

1. **Create New Policy**: In Azure AD, navigate to Security > Conditional Access and create a new policy.
2. **Assign Users**: Apply the policy to the users/groups who will be using EmailAll-2FA.
3. **Configure Access Controls**: Under 'Grant', select 'Require multi-factor authentication'.
4. **Select Authentication Method**: Choose the EmailAll-2FA method as the required secondary authentication.

### Step 4: Email System Integration

1. **Setup Email Trigger**: Integrate with the organization's email system to trigger an authentication email whenever a 2FA request is initiated.
2. **Reply-All Mechanism**: Ensure the authentication email contains instructions for the user to perform a 'reply all' action with their unique code.

### Step 5: Verification and Approval Process

1. **Implement Monitoring System**: Set up a system to monitor 'reply all' emails for the unique codes.
2. **Approval Mechanism**: Create a protocol for organization members to approve or deny access requests based on the 'reply all' emails.

## Testing and Deployment

- **Pilot Testing**: Conduct thorough testing with a small group of users to ensure the functionality and security of the EmailAll-2FA method.
- **Organization-Wide Rollout**: After successful testing, gradually roll out the EmailAll-2FA method across the organization.

## Conclusion

Implementing EmailAll-2FA in Azure AD using OATH provides an innovative, albeit satirical, approach to 2FA, leveraging the power of collective organizational involvement. This guide outlines the necessary steps to integrate this method within an Azure AD environment.
